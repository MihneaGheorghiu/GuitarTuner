# GuitarTuner
A program for tuning guitars, written using embedded C (ATmega 16 + microphone + display)

It's a C project, github shows it as HTML because it has only a .c file which is in the project folder, and there is a html file showing the components of the board.

Check the .doc file for project specifications (details)
